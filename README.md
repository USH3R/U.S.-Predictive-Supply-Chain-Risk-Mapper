The **US Predictive Supply Chain Risk Mapper** is a hackathon-ready cybersecurity tool designed to help federal agencies predict supply chain risk for vendors, visualize dependencies, and provide actionable mitigation strategies. Built entirely in **Python + SQL + Dash**, this tool combines predictive modeling with interactive dashboards for real-time risk assessment.

## How to Run the Application

1. Open Codespace (Github) or any terminal and type this:
         
         bash run.sh
         
2. Or try the manual executable way (optional):
   Open Codespace (Github) or any terminal and type this:
         
         chmod +x run.sh
         
   Press enter.
   Then type:
         
         ./run.sh
         
## Features

1. **Vendor Risk Collection**
   - Pull CVE feeds, GitHub leaks, and other public signals.
   - Store vendor information and dependencies in a SQL database.

2. **Predictive Risk Scoring**
   - Simple AI/ML model predicts probability of vendor compromise within 30–90 days.
   - Early-warning system to anticipate supply chain attacks.

3. **Supply Chain Mapping**
   - Visualize vendor dependencies in an interactive network graph.
   - Identify cascading risks that affect multiple agencies.

4. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - Built using **Dash (Python)** for real-time monitoring.
   - Displays risk scores, vendor tables, and dependency maps.
   - Highlights high-risk vendors for fast decision-making.

5. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - Suggest mitigation strategies automatically.
   - Generate briefing-ready reports for agency leadership.

## Architecture Diagram
Vendor Data (CVE feeds, APIs, GitHub leaks)
→
Python Scraper / Data Processor 
→
SQL Database (Stores vendors, risk scores, dependencies)
→
Predictive Model (Python ML, e.g., scikit-learn or simple logic)
→
Dash Dashboard (Risk maps, vendor graph, score tables)


**Minimal, hackathon-ready:**

Python – scraping, processing, predictive modeling, backend logic

SQL – storing vendor data, CVEs, risk scores

Dash (Python library) – front-end dashboard and visualizations

- Optional / advanced later:

Neo4j – graph database for supply chain relationships

Docker – containerization for easy deployment

**Future Enhancements**

Add real-time dark web / threat feed monitoring.
Integrate advanced ML predictive models.
Expand dashboard with Neo4j graph visualizations.
Automate mitigation suggestions and alerting.
Potential Federal Impact

This tool provides federal agencies with:

Real-time vendor risk assessment.
Early detection of supply chain threats.
Actionable recommendations for mitigation.
Visualizations for cascading risks across government dependencies.

By combining predictive modeling and interactive dashboards, this tool could strengthen U.S. federal cybersecurity posture and reduce the risk of attacks similar to the SolarWinds supply chain breach.
